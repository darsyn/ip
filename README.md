[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darsyn/ip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darsyn/ip)

IP is an immutable value object for (both version 4 and 6) IP addresses. Several
helper methods are provided for ranges, broadcast and network addresses, subnet
masks, whether an IP is a certain type (defined by RFC's), etc.

This project aims for simplicity of use and any contribution towards that goal -
whether a bug report, modifications to the codebase, or an improvement to the
accuracy or readability of the documentation - are always welcome.

# Documentation

Full documentation is available in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder.

## Code of Conduct

This project includes and adheres to the [Contributor Covenant as a Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Upgrading

This library is fairly similar to how it was in `3.3.1`; the main differences
are:

- There are three main classes instead of one: [`IPv4`](src/Version/IPv4.php),
  [`IPv6`](src/Version/IPv6.php), and [`Multi`](src/Version/Multi.php) (for both
  version 4 and 6 addresses).
- Objects are created using a static factory method
  [`IpInterface::factory()`](src/IpInterface.php) instead of the constructor to
  speed up internal processes.
- A few methods have been renamed (see [the API reference](docs/09-api.md)).
- Finally, the default for representing version 4 addresses internally has
  changed [from IPv4-compatible to IPv4-mapped](docs/05-strategies.md).

## Brief Example

```php
<?php

use Darsyn\IP\Exception;
use Darsyn\IP\Version\IPv4;

try {
    $ip = IPv4::factory('192.168.0.1');
} catch (Exception\InvalidIpAddressException $e) {
    exit('The IP address supplied is invalid!');
}

$companyNetwork = IPv4::factory('216.58.198.174');
if (!$ip->inRange($companyNetwork, 25)) {
    throw new \Exception('Request not from a known company IP address.');
}

// Is it coming from the local network?
if (!$ip->isPrivateUse()) {
    record_visit($ip->getBinary(), $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
}
```
